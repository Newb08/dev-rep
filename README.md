This Repository is for getting familiar with git version control and github while developing

New things learned:
    1. Gitignore stores the file and folders to be ignored from local directories.
    2. We ignore node_modules in nodejs projects, as the modules needed in projects are specified in package.json.
    3. Modules required in develepment environment are stored in "devDependencies" property and modules for production environment
       (Product in testing/usage) are stord in "dependencies" property of package.json.
    4. NODE_ENV stores the env currently in usage
